	  SE Related Elective Courses:<br>
	  &nbsp 1. SE 409:<br>
	  &nbsp &nbsp SE 409 impacted my role as a software engineer because I learened the importance of requirements and some of the best methods for finding the requirements.<br>
	  &nbsp 2. SE 416:<br>
	  &nbsp &nbsp SE 416 impacted my role as a software engineer by showing me the process of software development over time.  It also taught me how to analyze and evaluate software.<br>
	  &nbsp 3. CPRE 388:<br>
	  &nbsp &nbsp This class taught me about mobile development and specifically android development which is extremely important if one wants to stay relevant in this industry.<br><br>
	  Short and Long Term Goals:<br>
	  &nbsp For my short term goals I plan on graduatingin the fall of 2016.  After graduation I plan on getting a full time position at Rockwell Collins as a software engineer.  My long term goals are that I would continue to work for Rockwell Collins or a company in aviation and eventually work my way up to a management position.<br><br>
	  What I learned from general electives:<br>
	  &nbsp The courses that I have taken for general electives have helped me to think in a different way.  To me it seems like engineering classes require you to think about problems in a certain perspective.  When you get into general elective courses you have to think about problems differently than engineering problems.  When you then go back to working on engineering problems you consider the way that you thought about problems in the general elective courses and also the way you think of engineering problems.<br><br>
	  How general electives influence engineering:<br>
	  &nbsp One instance I can think of when I used what I learned in general education electives was in my SE 409 class. For that class we had a project where we had to work on requirements elicitation.  One thing that we had to conisder was different peoples perspectives.  This is something that I have also talked about in general elective courses.  When general education classes and engineering classes are mixed it has a profound impact on innovation on every level.  It helps those who are making decisions about products to conisder every aspect of the project not just the technical aspects.
