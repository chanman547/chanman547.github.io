        <p>Senior Design:<br>For my senior design project I am  currently working on developing a system to control agricultural vehicles  remotely.  I have three group members  that I am working with.  I am the  communication lead in the project. This entails making sure our client and  advisor are up to date on everything going on in our project. I also work to  make sure all members of the group are communicating what they are doing.  Since we started this project this semester  we have not decided on the technologies yet.</p>

<p>CS 309:<br>For my CS 309 project I worked on  creating a remote control Roomba that could autonomous map an environment.  There were 4 of us working on this project  and I was in charge of developing the app that would control the Roomba.  For this project we used java for the app,  C/C++ for the server, and also for the mapping algorithm.</p>

<p>CprE 381 Final Project:<br>For my CprE 381 final project we  had to make a MIPS processor with a pipeline.   I worked with one other person for this project.  During this project we both worked on  connecting all the components that we coded throughout the semester.  The final product of all of these components  combined was the processor.  We did all  of the coding for this project in VHDL.</p>

<p>CS 327 Project(s):<br>For CS 327 we are making a  Rougelike game similar to NetHack.  This  game will be developed by me individually throughout the semester.  It will be developed in C/C++.  To this point the game has included creating  the map for the game, working with file IO, player control, and a path finding  algorithm to different points on the map.</p>
