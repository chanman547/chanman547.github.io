	   I think that throughout my time at ISU I have been prepared very for the real world of engineering. Some of the key things they taught me were to design and implement different processes. I have done this in many classes implementing a variety of processes for a variety of purposes.  While implementing these processes I have learned to solve engineering problems.  Solving these problems has taught me how my solutions to these problems can have an impact in a global or societal context.  This especially will come in to play when working in industry and designing products for people to be used around the world.</p>
	  <p> There have been at least 3 classes that I can think of that were specifically classes for group work that I have taken at ISU.  Through these classes I learned how to manage and work with a team to solve real problems.  These classes also taught me how to be professional with all the work I do.  These classes also have talked about ethics and that I am required to act ethically in all work that I do.</p>
	  <p> To complete the projects I have worked on in class I have needed a variety of resources. One of the main resources I used was other students in my major who had gone through similar experiences as me.  They were able to help point me in the right direction and give me the right tools to do what I needed to do.  I also found very quickly how to search the Internet for problems that I had and there were very good resources that I found that helped me with my classwork.</p>
	<p>They helped me to know what I needed to learn to be successful in the work place.  The career fairs especially helped me when talking to potential employers because I got to see what they were looking for and what I had to learn to get there.  I also found out quickly that our procession is not something that you can just learn in college.  It is a constant lifelong process where you can always be learning new things and looking for ways to improve on old methods.</p>
	<p>I have not started any new learning to improve my ability to apply skills or know	ledge to new problems and to develop confidence in taking risks.  Presently I do not have time to be learning these new skills but in the future I plan to learn skills that will help build my confidence in solving problems and taking risks.</p>
	<p>If I were to do undergraduate work again I would.  I would have gone to older classmates for advice sooner.  When I went to my older classmates I found that they were able to relate to my problems in ways that my professors couldn't.  I would have also tired to take more non engineering classes to help me look at those types of problems in a different way than I do.  I would also have like to try and take more classes and try and get done sooner than I did.
